Project Description
EnergyAgent is a Python-based AI agent designed to detect hidden energy waste in appliances and usage patterns. Built with Flask and Streamlit, it demonstrates a modular agent architecture with:

Input Understanding – parses user prompts about appliances and energy usage

State Tracker – resets context between runs to avoid stale data

Task Planner – decides logical steps for analysis

Output Generator – streams results word-by-word with a modern, premium UI

Key highlights:

Real-time streaming output with typing effect

Futuristic UI with glowing loaders and responsive design

Transparent, modular pipeline for easy debugging and extension

Demo video and screenshots included for interview showcase

This project is built to demonstrate hands-on AI development skills, combining intelligent reasoning with a standout user experience.
